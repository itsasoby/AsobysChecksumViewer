This is a simple checksum viewer built on .NET WinForms for a job qualification test.

The functionality included is:
- View the files in an entire folder and its subfolders
- Choose between different checksum algorithms (MD5, SHA1, SHA256...)
- Sorting lists of files
- And a lot more!

The code is as modular as I could get it to be.
